# UnityError

## Introduction

Modern GUI is like a projection of the whole programming domain to a smaller scale. That is in that there are too many ways to do it wrong.

# Definition

UnityError is a standard of robust error halding in GUI driven software systems.

The standard introduces a number of concepts.

## UnityError Object

This definition correlates to an object that represents an error produced by a FAEI. An exception (an error) object of a given high-level programming language is said to be UnityError-compliant when it is produced by a FAEI.

## FAEI: Finite Abstraction Extent Interface

This definition correlates to a programming interface that covers precisely one level of a finite programming abstraction extent. The abstraction extent of a programming interface is said to be finite when there is a certain guarantee that each member of a set of concepts, processes and definitions, formed from the union of concepts, processes and definitions defined by the abstraction and concepts, processes and definitions defined by the interface, can be classified as "making sense in the context of that particular union of concepts, processes and definitions defined by the abstraction and concepts, processes and definitions defined by the interface". A programming interface is said to cover precisely one level of a finite programming abstraction extent when there exists precisely one union of concepts, processes and definitions defined by the abstraction and of concepts, processes and definitions defined by the interface.
